### 2. **Development Environment Setup** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Environment not configured for development
- **Improvements**:
  - Fixed package.json scripts to use npm instead of pnpm
  - Created PM2 ecosystem configuration for daemon management
  - Successfully launched Vite development server on port 3000
  - Server accessible at: `https://3000-ijnxyub6mt389x6d0jxad-6532622b.e2b.dev`

### 3. **CSV Upload Functionality Enhancement** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: CSV upload reliability problems mentioned by user
- **Major Improvements**:
  - Created robust `csvParser.ts` utility with advanced parsing logic
  - Handles quoted values, commas within quotes, and various CSV formats
